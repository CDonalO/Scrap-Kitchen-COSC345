        "Material is the metaphor.\n\n"

        "A material metaphor is the unifying theory of a rationalized space and a system of motion."
        "The material is grounded in tactile reality, inspired by the study of paper and ink, yet "
        "technologically advanced and open to imagination and magic.\n"
        "Surfaces and edges of the material provide visual cues that are grounded in reality. The "
        "use of familiar tactile attributes helps users quickly understand affordances. Yet the "
        "flexibility of the material creates new affordances that supercede those in the physical "
        "world, without breaking the rules of physics.\n"
        "The fundamentals of light, surface, and movement are key to conveying how objects move, "
        "interact, and exist in space and in relation to each other. Realistic lighting shows "
        "seams, divides space, and indicates moving parts.\n\n"

        "Bold, graphic, intentional.\n\n"

        "The foundational elements of print based design typography, grids, space, scale, color, "
        "and use of imagery guide visual treatments. These elements do far more than please the "
        "eye. They create hierarchy, meaning, and focus. Deliberate color choices, edge to edge "
        "imagery, large scale typography, and intentional white space create a bold and graphic "
        "interface that immerse the user in the experience.\n"
        "An emphasis on user actions makes core functionality immediately apparent and provides "
        "waypoints for the user.\n\n"

        "Motion provides meaning.\n\n"

        "Motion respects and reinforces the user as the prime mover. Primary user actions are "
        "inflection points that initiate motion, transforming the whole design.\n"
        "All action takes place in a single environment. Objects are presented to the user without "
        "breaking the continuity of experience even as they transform and reorganize.\n"
        "Motion is meaningful and appropriate, serving to focus attention and maintain continuity. "
        "Feedback is subtle yet clear. Transitions are efﬁcient yet coherent.\n\n"

        "3D world.\n\n"

        "The material environment is a 3D space, which means all objects have x, y, and z "
        "dimensions. The z-axis is perpendicularly aligned to the plane of the display, with the "
        "positive z-axis extending towards the viewer. Every sheet of material occupies a single "
        "position along the z-axis and has a standard 1dp thickness.\n"
        "On the web, the z-axis is used for layering and not for perspective. The 3D world is "
        "emulated by manipulating the y-axis.\n\n"

        "Light and shadow.\n\n"

        "Within the material environment, virtual lights illuminate the scene. Key lights create "
        "directional shadows, while ambient light creates soft shadows from all angles.\n"
        "Shadows in the material environment are cast by these two light sources. In Android "
        "development, shadows occur when light sources are blocked by sheets of material at "
        "various positions along the z-axis. On the web, shadows are depicted by manipulating the "
        "y-axis only. The following example shows the card with a height of 6dp.\n\n"

        "Resting elevation.\n\n"

        "All material objects, regardless of size, have a resting elevation, or default elevation "
        "that does not change. If an object changes elevation, it should return to its resting "
        "elevation as soon as possible.\n\n"

        "Component elevations.\n\n"

        "The resting elevation for a component type is consistent across apps (e.g., FAB elevation "
        "does not vary from 6dp in one app to 16dp in another app).\n"
        "Components may have different resting elevations across platforms, depending on the depth "
        "of the environment (e.g., TV has a greater depth than mobile or desktop).\n\n"

        "Responsive elevation and dynamic elevation offsets.\n\n"

        "Some component types have responsive elevation, meaning they change elevation in response "
        "to user input (e.g., normal, focused, and pressed) or system events. These elevation "
        "changes are consistently implemented using dynamic elevation offsets.\n"
        "Dynamic elevation offsets are the goal elevation that a component moves towards, relative "
        "to the component’s resting state. They ensure that elevation changes are consistent "
        "across actions and component types. For example, all components that lift on press have "
        "the same elevation change relative to their resting elevation.\n"
        "Once the input event is completed or cancelled, the component will return to its resting "
        "elevation.\n\n"

        "Avoiding elevation interference.\n\n"

        "Components with responsive elevations may encounter other components as they move between "
        "their resting elevations and dynamic elevation offsets. Because material cannot pass "
        "through other material, components avoid interfering with one another any number of ways, "
        "whether on a per component basis or using the entire app layout.\n"
        "On a component level, components can move or be removed before they cause interference. "
        "For example, a floating action button (FAB) can disappear or move off screen before a "
        "user picks up a card, or it can move if a snackbar appears.\n"
        "On the layout level, design your app layout to minimize opportunities for interference. "
        "For example, position the FAB to one side of stream of a cards so the FAB won’t interfere "
        "when a user tries to pick up one of cards.\n\n"

        "North America the land of opportunity! Since this area was mostly migrated by individuals "
        "from all over the world the food influences range this much as well. The Caribbean was highly "
        "influenced by African cuisine while America has taken a bit of everything with a massive "
        "Italian community in New York to Asian influence in San Francisco and don't get me started "
        "about those French up in Canada. I guess the only thing they can claim as their own is "

        "South American cuisine is actually a fusion of indigenous, Spanish and African influence. In central america you would find more european influence using maze, beans, tomatoes and are fresh flavorful and most of all colorful. Mexico is actually the only real country throughout that loves spicy food and incorporates the use of fresh chillies in mostly every dish so hope you like to get your sweet on!, The rest of the continent you will find africa and spanish written all over it with stews complemented with rice and beans, perfect for that sunday dinner."

    <string name="europe_blurb">"As you can probably guess europe has a wide range of diversity within its eating culture since it is deep in history every you look. Countries like Germany and Poland have their own dishes as does Spain and Italy. Europe is more than a continent, it’s a land filled with dozens upon dozens of histories. Each has its own flavors and while some areas have more in common than others, each has its specialties as well. The French, for example, are known for their rich desserts. The Germans for their sausages, and the Italians for their pasta. It's all European!!!!"</string>
    <string name="asia_title">"Asia"</string>
    <string name="asia_blurb">
        "Asia is the largest and most populous continent in the world so everywhere you go the local culture and history will be incorporated in the meals you eat. Asian cuisine loves the use of chillies, garlic, ginger, soy, and of course fluffy white rice and lots of it! Everybody around the world knows thai green currys, ramen from japan, sweet and sour from china or korean BBQ but people forget that the middle eat is actually apart of Asia which in itself has a completely different cuisine and culture, who doesn't love a kebab after a night out."

    <string name="africa_title">"Africa"</string>
    <string name="africa_blurb">"Africa is an extremely diverse continent, African cuisine can be broken down into a few distinct regions: Northern, Southern, Central, Eastern, and Western Africa. Northern Africa mostly uses seafood, goat, lamb or beef since it ranges along the mediterranean sea and influences of Morocco can be seen throughout. Southern Africa enjoys BBQ style meats served with seeds and vegetables. Central Africa is a harsh land and the really only spicy african foods can be found here growing their own chillies. Eastern Africa mostly produces cron based meals served with stew. Western Africa is very rice based meals served with mostly root based vegetables."</string>
    <string name="oceania_title">"Oceania"</string>
    <string name="oceania_blurb">"When you think of Oceania your mind goes straight to Australia and New Zealand and of course meat pies and Sunday roast but these two nations along with all the islands that occupy this massive continent are surrounded by water, so seafood is a huge part of all cuisine throughout. The smaller islands are mostly influenced by the countries that colonized them. For example, Fiji is influenced by India and the Philippines is influenced by Spain. This was one of the last continents to be settled which means influence from all around the world are found here but you won't find a better place to get a pavlova than right here in New Zealand."</string>
