[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/d5c70c69b5bb40d7889c29f1e3170bb4)](https://app.codacy.com/gh/CDonalO/Scrap-Kitchen-COSC345?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=CDonalO/Scrap-Kitchen-COSC345&utm_campaign=Badge_Grade_Settings)

In the current alpha version the working features are

  - recipe filtering by region or ingredient
  - basic shopping list
  - pre populated meal planner which can be clicked on to take the user to a recipe
  - Navigation scheme

The design of the app is still very rough and this is something we will be focussing on prior to the beta release

App has been tested on a google pixel 5 using gesture navigation
