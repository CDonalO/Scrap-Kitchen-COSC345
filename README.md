#Scrap Kitchen

In the current alpha version the working features are

  - recipe filtering by region or ingredient
  - basic shopping list
  - pre populated meal planner which can be clicked on to take the user to a recipe
  - Navigation scheme

The design of the app is still very rough and this is something we will be focussing on prior to the beta release

App has been tested on a google pixel 5 using gesture navigation
