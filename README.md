#Scrap Kitchen

In the current beta version the working features are

-   recipe filtering by continent
-   shopping list
    - Items can be added via the shopping list or by adding recipe ingredients via a recipe
-   meal planner 
    - Meals can be added to the meal planner via a recipe
-   Navigation scheme

What our beta release has improved: 
- Users can now adjust the meal planner by adding meals to particular days
- Users can now add items from a recipe to the shopping list
- The design has been upgraded - most notably, our home page with continent filtering

The design of the app is still rough and this is something we will be focussing on prior to the final release

App has been tested on a google pixel 5 using gesture navigation
