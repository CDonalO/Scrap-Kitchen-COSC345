#Scrap Kitchen

After completing the beta user testing we where given a few ideas on what we could change given the 
feedback that we where given:

- One major feedback was that is was hard to find out where the button was to actually add the 
  recipes to the meal planner and your shopping list, the three dotted add button was the wrong design choice

We have changed this to a option box in the bottom right corner which is easy to see and once opened the two option expand to 
allow you to ether add a recipe to your weekly meal planner or add to shopping list. 

- We where asked to implement some way of viewing all the recipes from the main screen, the current way to do
  so is by selecting Antarctica and view the recipes from there. 

Researching this we find this quit hard to figure out so out solution was to add a description on how to navigate the app
main screen, with this we describe how by clicking on the Antarctica continent you can access all the recipes. 

There where a few design feature's that where recommended to update: 
- rounding off the button corners to make it look more appealing 

In the shopping list feature we have rounded off all shopping list items that you add to the list as well as changing the colour 
of the selected item when ticking it off.

There where a few suggestion for the app that unfortunately where just to much for as to be able to expand on since most of
them involved updating the entire data base which we decided as a group we wouldn't touch once the beta was released so we
wouldn't add any more bugs into the software.
Things like adding photos for each recipe instead of the country emoji would of been a nice touch and adding nutritional 
information into every recipe.

The last major change we did was change the app from the MVC architecture to MVVM which we believed was a better choice for our app

with respect to the copyright of all the recipes, there are many source that say the copy right of recipes are only so when
the recipe itself is completely original eg "from my grandma" but the idea itself can not be. All these recipes have been 
slightly altered from the various websites they where gained from including some methods so in fact can even be seen as original.


App has been tested on a google pixel 5 using gesture navigation
